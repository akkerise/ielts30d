Exercise 2. Read the following passage and answer questions 1-28.

PART 1

A

Air pollution is increasingly becoming the focus of government and citizen concern around the
globe. From Mexico City and New York to Singapore and Tokyo, new solutions to this old
problem are being proposed, mailed and implemented with ever increasing speed. It is feared
that unless pollution reduction measures are able to keep pace with the continued pressures of
urban growth, air quality in many of the world’s major cities will deteriorate beyond reason.

B

Action is being taken along several fronts: through new legislation, improved enforcement and
innovative technology. In Los Angeles, state regulations are forcing manufacturers to try to

sell ever cleaner cars: their first of the cleanest, titled "Zero Emission Vehicles’, have to be
available soon, since they are intended to make up 2 percent of sales in 1997. Local authorities
in London are campaigning to be allowed to enforce anti-pollution laws themselves; at present
only the police have the power to do so, but they tend to be busy elsewhere. In Singapore,
renting out road space to users is the way of the future.

C

When Britain’s Royal Automobile Club monitored the exhausts of 60,000 vehicles, it found
that 12 percent of them produced more than half the total pollution. Older cars were the worst
offenders; though a sizeable number of quite new cars were also identified as gross polluters,
they were simply badly tuned. California has developed a scheme to get these gross polluters
off the streets: they offer a flat $700 for any old, run-down vehicle driven in by its owner. The
aim is to remove the heaviest-polluting, most decrepit vehicles from the roads.

D

As part of a European Union environmental programme, a London council is restoring an infra-
red spectrometer from the University of Denver in Colorado. It gauges the pollution from a
passing vehicle - more useful than the annual stationary rest that is the British standard today -
by bouncing a beam through the exhaust and measuring what gets blocked. The council’s next
step may be to link the system to a computerised video camera able to read number plates
automatically.

E

The effort to clean up cars may do little to cut pollution if nothing is done about the tendency
to drive them more. Los Angeles has some of the world’s cleanest cars - far better than those
of Europe - but the total number of miles those cars drive continues to grow. One solution is
car-pooling, an arrangement in which a number of people who share the same destination share
the use of one car. However, the average number of people in a car on the freeway in Los
Angeles, which is 1.0, has been falling steadily. Increasing it would be an effective way of
reducing emissions as well as easing congestion. The trouble is, Los Angelinos seem to like
being alone in their cars.

F

Singapore has for a while had a scheme that forces drivers to buy a badge if they wish to visit
a certain part of the city. Electronic innovations make possible increasing sophistication: rates

can vary according to road conditions, time of day and so on. Singapore is advancing in this
direction, with a city-wide network of transmitters to collect information and charge drivers as
they pass certain points. Such road-pricing, however, can be controversial. When the local
government in Cambridge, England, considered introducing Singaporean techniques, it faced
vocal and ultimately successful opposition.

PART 2

The scope of the problem facing the world’s cities is immense. In 1992, the United Nations
Environmental Programme and the World Health Organisation (WHO) concluded that all of a
sample of twenty megacities - places likely to have more than ten million inhabitants in the year
2000 - already exceeded the level the WHO deems healthy in at least one major pollutant. Two-
thirds of them exceeded the guidelines for two, seven for three or more.

Of the six pollutants monitored by the WHO - carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulphur
dioxide, lead and particulate matter - it is this last category that is attracting the most attention
from health researchers. PM10, a subcategory of particulate matter measuring ten-millionths of
a meter across, has been implicated in thousands of deaths a year in Britain alone. Research
being conducted in two counties of Southern California is reaching similarly disturbing
conclusions concerning this little-understood pollutant.

A worldwide rise in allergies, particularly asthma, over the past four decades is now said to be
linked with increased air pollution. The lungs and brains of children who grow up in polluted
air offer further evidence of its destructive power; the old and ill; however, are the most
vulnerable to the acute effects of heavily polluted stagnant air. It can actually hasten death,
so it did in December 1991 when a cloud of exhaust fumes lingered over the city of London for
over a week.

The United Nations has estimated that in the year 2000 there will be twenty-four mega-cities
and a further eighty-five cities of more than three million people. The pressure on public
officials, corporations and urban citizens to reverse established trends in air pollution is likely
to grow in proportion with the growth of cities themselves. Progress is being made. The
question, though, remains the same: ‘Will change happen quickly enough?’
