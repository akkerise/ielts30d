**Instructions:** Fill in the blanks with the correct form of the words to complete the following IELTS Speaking Part 3 question.

Question: What can be done to motivate people so that they abide by the rules and law?

Most people 1…………………… (not want) to follow any rules or regulations in their daily
life. It 2…………………… (be) natural that they will ignore the law. The state is responsible
for making them follow the rules. But if the government 3…………………… (follow) the strict
measures to make the citizens follow the state rules, that may 4…………………… (result) in
negative effects; thus, some promotional or motivational positive measures should
5……………………                (take).   The     government     may    start   some     initiatives   like
6…………………… (reward) the law-abiding citizens with different titles like ‘Man of the
Year’, or similar other events. On the other side, it appears to me that most of the time the rules
7…………………… (be) difficult for people to follow as those are complicated for them. So,
during the rules-making process, the government should try to keep the rules as straight-forward
as possible. If the rules are easier to follow and the government 8…………………… (start)
promoting people, I think it will inspire people naturally to follow the rules.

### Exercise 2: Reading Comprehension

**Passage Title:** Is There Really a War on Drugs?

A

In our contemporary society, the media constantly bombards us with horror stories about drugs
like crack-cocaine. From them, and probably from no other source, we learn that crack is
immediately addictive in every case, we learn that it causes corruption, crazed violence, and
almost always leads to death. The government tells us that we are busy fighting a war on drugs
and so it gives us various iconic models to despise and detest: we learn to stereotype inner-city
minorities as being of drug-infested wastelands and we learn to "witch hunt" drug users within
our own communities under the belief that they represent moral sin and pure evil. I believe that
these titles and ideals are preposterous and based entirely upon unnecessary and even
detrimental ideals promoted by the government to achieve purposes other than those they claim.

B

In Craig Renarman's and Harry Levine's article entitled "The Crack Attack: Politics and Media
in America's Latest Drug Scare," the authors attempt to expose and to deal with some of the
societal problems that have resulted from the over-exaggeration of crack-cocaine as an
"epidemic problem" in our country. Without detracting attention away from the serious health
risks for those few individuals who do use the drug, Renarman and Levine demonstrate how
minimally detrimental the current "epidemic" actually is.

C

Early in the article, the authors summarize crack-cocaine's evolutionary history in the U.S. They
specifically discuss how the crack-related deaths of two star-athletes which first called wide-
spread attention to the problem during the mid-1980's. Since then, the government has
reportedly used crack-cocaine as a political scapegoat for many of the nation's larger inner-city
problems. Thefts, violence, and even socioeconomic depression have been blamed on crack.
They assert that the government has invested considerably in studies whose results could be
used to wage the constant "war on drugs" while to politicians, that war has amounted to nothing
more than a perceptual war on poverty and urban crime.

D

Since politicians have had little else of marketable interest to debate over the years, this
aggressive attack on drugs has existed as one of their only colorful means by which to create

debate, controversy, and campaign fuel. In other words, when balancing the budget and
maintaining an effective foreign policy became too boring to handle, Reinarman and Levine
assert that the "crack epidemic" became the focus of politicians with the intent of luring public
interest to their flashy anti-drug campaigns.

E

Finally, in addition to the media's excess attention on the 'war against drugs', Reinarman and
Levine make the point that the constant coverage of crack in the news media has only been
counterproductive to the alleged goals of any anti-drug program. With descriptions of the "crack
high" that glorify it considerably- the politically-charged media campaigns to fight drugs have
worked somewhat ironically as huge advertising campaigns for crack-increasing public
awareness and stimulating the interests of venturous junkies.

F

While Reinarman and Levine are rather adamant about their findings, they do maintain an overt
respect for the reality that crack has had other causal factors and outcomes besides those
described by them. Their main concern seems to be calling for a more realistic spotlight to be
placed upon the problem- so that we can begin to deal with it as no more and no less than what
should be.

G

The "war on drugs" is indeed based upon an exaggeration of facts. Although it is also evident
that substances such as crack-cocaine may serve to pose great health risks to those that use
them, there is not any widespread "epidemic" use of the drug nor any validity to the apparent
myths that it causes such immediate devastation and is life-wrecking in every single case.

It is obvious that we do indeed need to maintain a greater and more focused emphasis on the
important and more widespread problems in society. Important energies and well-needed
money are being diverted from them to fight in an almost-imaginary battle against a controlled
substance. Conclusively, we should allow drugs like crack-cocaine receive their due attention
as social problems, but let them receive no more than that!

### Exercise 1: Writing Task 2 - Essay Completion

**Instructions:** Complete the following IELTS Writing Task 2 essay with words from the box below.

| Word 1 | Word 2 |
|---------|---------|
| trustworthy | platform |
| enriched | excessive |
| virtual | objective |
| addicted | far-reaching |
| isolated | inferiority |

### Topic
**Nowadays more people prefer to socialize online rather than face to face. Is this a positive or negative development?**

### Sample Essay

People are glued to their cellphones and tablets. They are constantly updating their status on
social networks and checking out the photos and videos uploaded by their (1)…………………
friends. In fact, most of us now have more friends online than in the real world. In my opinion,
this is a negative development that can have (2)………………… consequences.

(3)………………… online socialization can lead to depression, isolation and behavioural
problems. The internet is a great (4)………………… to share views and opinions, but it also
fuels unhealthy competition among people. Studies have shown that people develop an
(5)………………… complex when their friends get more comments or likes than them.

Social media has many negative sides. There is no guarantee that the people we meet online are
actually real. Many of them create fake profiles with the (6)………………… of cheating naïve
users. There have been several instances of teenagers committing suicide after they got cheated
by their online friends. Most people who are (7)………………… to online socialisation have
hardly any time for talking to their family members or neighbours. This affects family
relationships. Also, it can cause the individual to become (8)………………… from his
community.

Face to face communications, on the other hand, lead to the development of
(9)………………… relationships that last long. Meeting a friend or a dear one over a coffee or
in a park is always a memorable experience. Social media friendships lack that warmth. Also,
we cannot expect our online friends living in another part of the globe to help us when we are
in trouble.

To conclude, it is not hard to see that excessive online socialization is bad. It affects our
relationships. It is true that the internet has (10)………………… our lives in many ways, but
if we are addicted to it, we will develop many problems. After all, the virtual world cannot
replace the real world; neither can virtual friends replace the real ones.

### Exercise 2: Reading Comprehension

**Title:** Social Media Privacy – A Contradiction in Terms?  
**Author:** Naomi Troni, Global CMO of Euro RSCG Worldwide

A

Never in the course of human interaction have so many shared so much about themselves with
so many others – and with so little apparent concern for their privacy. Was it really just a
generation ago that people kept all but their most basic information under virtual lock and key?
Today, we happily share our date and place of birth, name of our first pet, mother’s maiden
name, favourite movie or book, favourite colour, first school teacher – and myriad other
snippets of information required by online services as part of their security procedures.

B

The basic premise behind this information-sharing is nothing new. Consumers have long
handed over a little personal information in exchange for services such as banking and finance,
utilities and healthcare. The big difference now is that the information is digitized and
accessible online – and we’re handing it out to virtually anyone who asks, regardless of how
briefly the business has been in existence. Of even greater concern to many is the amount and
variety of information being gathered about us without our explicit permission. Whereas
retailers and others used to tweeze out information gleaned through loyalty cards, prize draws
and catalogue mailing lists, now these old standbys have been massively augmented by
customers researching and purchasing online, leaving in their wake a digital trail of cookie
crumbs detailing their needs, tastes and desires.

C

And then there’s social media. If this isn’t the Holy Grail* for marketers, it’s difficult to imagine
what would be. In this thoroughly 21st century communications channel, old notions of privacy
simply do not apply; sharing personal information, experiences and opinions is the whole point
of the service. And, wonder of wonders, consumers don’t only provide it willingly – they
provide it for free! Sure, some people take the precaution of limiting access to their Facebook
or Google+ pages, but even these people typically are eager to share their thoughts via comment
sections on news sites, reviews on retail sites and in branded clubs and forums.

D

With all the time we spend online and all the forums we frequent, it’s no wonder most of us
have grown accustomed to doling out little snippets of personal information with barely a
second thought. It helps that we rarely are asked to hand over a whole stack of personal
information in one massive data transfer; that would be too much trouble and might provoke
too much anxiety. Rather, we routinely hand it out a bit at a time.

E

Anybody over the age of 30 likely will remember that in the early days of mainstream Internet,
10 to 15 years ago, consumers were wary about handing over private information. A 2001
UCLA report, for instance, found high levels of consumer concern over online privacy in
general and credit card security in particular.

F

Since then hundreds of millions of people have come online and become regular users of
commerce sites and social media. Early concerns about online privacy have been sidelined by
the desire for more speed, more convenience, more choice and more great deals. Familiarity
has bred complacency and even foolhardiness; we’ve all heard about people uploading pretty
much everything, including the most intimate words and images.

G

Now, after a decade of consumers feeling increasingly free-and-easy with their personal
information online, we are seeing signs of a new wariness setting in. In a Euro RSCG global
survey conducted among 7,213 adults in 19 countries, we found that 55% of respondents are
worried that ‘technology is robbing us of our privacy’; the figure was above 60% in a number
of countries, including the United States and China. Similarly, 61 % overall agreed ‘People

share too much about their personal thoughts and experiences online; we need to go back to
being more private.’

H

And it’s not just snooping companies and hackers that consumers fear. Nearly half the sample
(47%) – and a majority of millennials – worry that friends or family will share inappropriate
personal information about them online. Around one-third overall already regret posting
personal information about themselves.

Last Supper with his followers)

### Exercise 2.

1. What kinds of possessions give status to people in your country?
That’s a good question. Let me think…I’d say it depends on where you are and who you are
with. If you are out in public, it is things like the car you are driving. If you have the latest
Mercedes Benz model, then in my country that is a sign of status, as most people can’t even
afford a car at all, whatever they make. Property, or the house you own, and the possessions
you have in it are also a sign of status. If you have a nice house in a nice area, then this shows
you have money and are someone important.

2. Has it always been the same or were different possessions thought of as valuable in the
   past?
I’m too young to remember exactly what it was like a long time ago, but yes, I think it was
different. For example, cars as I mentioned before only really came to our country in the last
ten years or so. That kind of consumerism is a fairly recent thing so this couldn’t have been
used as a representation of something valuable. I think it was things like gold and jewelry that
were seen as valuable. Of course these are still seen as valuable today, but previously it was
these things over anything else as a lot of the modern day possessions were not available.

3. Why do you think people need to show their status in society?
I believe that this is because it's important in society to show you have money or are successful
– it is nature, or the way we are brought up, that makes us feel like this, but also the pressure
that society puts on everyone to be successful. And showing status is basically showing that
you have money and you have success, so this is what people want to do. Going back to the
example of the car, driving around in a Mercedes is a very conspicuous show of status – it
basically says to people, “Look, I am successful and I have money.” Another reason is possibly

for respect. In many cultures, if someone has high status, then they will be respected by others
and they may receive preferential treatment.
